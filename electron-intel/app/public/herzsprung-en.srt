00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:10,630
District Court of Potsdam

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,950
10 December 1955

3
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:19,000
Verdict in trial for quadruple murder

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,550
Defendant: Wilhelm Antonius Wehren,

5
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:27,370
born on 30 May 1918 in Essen.

6
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:31,630
Place of crime: Herzsprung, near Wittstock (on the Dosse).

7
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:36,720
Date of crime: 30 April 1945.

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:43,280
Victims: Prisoners of Polish nationality, 
identity unknown.

9
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,500
Willi Wehren is 21 when the war begins.

10
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,480
In the summer of 1939, 
he is drafted into the Wehrmacht.

11
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,000
Wehren soon attracts negative attention:

12
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,900
accused of slander and the receipt of stolen goods,

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,250
he is tried by a military tribunal.

14
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:05,000
In 1943, he is ultimately accused of undermining military morale.

15
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,970
Wehren is sent to Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp.

16
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,000
It seems his fate is sealed.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,950
But in April 1945, his fortunes turn.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,120
The war’s end is looming.

19
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,000
The concentration camp is to be evacuated.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,120
To do so, the SS also enlists inmates as guards.

21
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,000
Willi Wehren is recruited as well,

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and is put in uniform again.

23
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:34,110
Issued with a rifle and ammunition,

24
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,400
he’s assigned to a column of five hundred women.

25
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,030
On 22 April, they set off on the long journey to the north.

26
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:47,250
Theirs is the last group to march from Sachsenhausen.

27
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,240
They wear little more than their threadbare prisoners’ uniforms.

28
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,900
Not all of them have shoes.

29
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:02,300
Many walk in wooden clogs or improvise with rags wrapped around their feet.

30
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,180
They walk day after day. Sometimes it’s 40 km, sometimes 20.

31
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,400
The thermometer barely gets gets above 0°C.

32
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,110
They sometimes find a barn for the night.

33
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:19,450
But more often, they sleep out in the open.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,750
Meanwhile, Wehren continues his rise.

35
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,070
He receives a motorcycle.

36
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,870
As a despatch rider, 
he maintains contact between marching groups.

37
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:32,100
He also has to look after the provisioning of his assigned group.

38
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,580
The march is torturous.

39
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,580
The prisoners are weakened by their long internment.

40
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,100
Many are sick and starved.

41
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,900
Those who can’t keep up are shot by the SS 
and kicked into the ditch.

42
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:56,610
More than a thousand dead are left on the roads and fields.

43
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,280
Whoever can, keeps going.

44
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,680
Endless processions of misery traverse the roads and villages.

45
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,600
There’s well over thirty thousand people.

46
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,350
Everyone can see them.

47
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,750
Hardly anyone feels sympathy for the prisoners,

48
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,890
and very few have the courage to help them.

49
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,920
Most react with mistrust, fear, or indifference.

50
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,330
So too in the little village of Herzsprung.

51
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:38,890
It’s here in this village that Willi Wehren has abandoned his unit.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He meets a man named Berger.

53
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,700
This is another ex-prisoner who was hastily put in uniform

54
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,730
when the death march began.

55
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,550
Wehren has taken up residence at the local inn.

56
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,000
He knows the innkeeper from before:

57
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,120
Wilhelm Leppin is an important man in Herzsprung.

58
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,310
He owns the inn and is also the local Nazi Party chief.

59
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,520
In this village, he’s in charge

60
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:11,220
 ... and the locals follow him willingly.

61
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,130
It’s Monday, the 30th of April.

62
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,980
In the morning, a 10-year-old boy comes running up to Leppin:

63
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,850
his mother has found four runaway prisoners in the barn!

64
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:27,680
Leppin, Wehren, and Berger
immediately rush to the woman’s farm

65
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,820
and find four frightened Polish prisoners

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,320
who had managed to escape the death march.

67
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,020
They force them out of hiding.

68
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,020
Wehren starts beating them.

69
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,020
Leppin finds a cudgel.

70
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,020
He likewise beats them and yells:

71
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,130
‘Come out here, you swine!’

72
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,600
The three men talk it over.

73
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,900
They don’t want any hassle.

74
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,820
To them, the Poles are a burden.

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,920
Leppin decides it’d be best to get rid of them.

76
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,760
A family in Herzsprung is getting ready to flee 
from the approaching Red Army.

77
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,810
They suddenly hear a clamour outside their window.

78
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,360
The Polish prisoners are being herded through Herzsprung,

79
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,100
across the village road and past the local homes to the village outskirts.

80
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:29,220
The family watches the entourage with its trail of curious onlookers,
 including several children.

81
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:41,070
Just before the gravel pit, on a small tree-covered slope,
the procession comes to a halt.

82
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,660
Among them is the local Nazi official Leppin.

83
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,800
He stays somewhat apart, smoking a cigar,

84
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,280
but follows the proceedings closely.

85
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,900
A scuffle begins.

86
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,220
One of the prisoners tries to escape.

87
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,990
Willi Wehren chases him and shoots.

88
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,260
The victim goes down, but is still alive.

89
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,760
Wehren flips him over with his foot and kills him

90
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,410
him with a shot to the back of the neck.

91
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,410
Berger and Wehren now force the remaining prisoners

92
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:22,800
around the slope to Herzsprung’s gravel pit.

93
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,390
What happens next is not visible to the onlookers.

94
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,130
But the tommy gun’s shots still echo through the whole village.

95
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,130
[shoots firing]

96
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,260
[shoots firing]

97
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,700
The villagers watch transfixed.

98
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,900
Seven witnesses claim they saw or heard

99
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,470
for themselves the execution of the camp prisoners.

100
00:06:54,670 --> 00:07:01,390
They testify that other villagers
 also followed the events from close up.

101
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,000
On 10 December 1955,

102
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,200
the Potsdam District Court sentences Wilhelm Wehren

103
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,970
to death for quadruple murder.

104
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:19,540
A year later, his sentence is commuted to life imprisonment.

105
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,760
In August 1975,
Wehren is pardoned and released from prison.

106
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,760
He moves to West Germany.

107
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:35,920
Leppin is arrested by the Soviet military authorities in May 1945.

108
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:40,100
As a Nazi Party official, 
he is sent to an internment camp.

109
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,670
He is released in August 1948.

110
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:47,970
He is never charged for the murders in Herzsprung.

111
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:52,130
The case against Leppin is dismissed due to his <i>‘minor responsibility’</i>.

112
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,730
He remains unpunished.

113
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:02,940
A denunciation, a capture, a public execution.

114
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:09,350
In broad daylight, in the middle of the village, in view of the people.

115
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,900
They stick together, and beyond the mass murder too:

116
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,140
the bodies are quickly buried, and with them,

117
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,250
the knowledge of that heinous event.

118
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,350
In Herzsprung, a silence gradually settles.

119
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,380
Soon, there is no one here who still remembers the Polish prisoners

120
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:31,210
that were executed in the village.

121
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,510
Their names remain unknown.
