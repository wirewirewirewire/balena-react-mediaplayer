00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,960
District Court of Potsdam. 10 December 1955.

2
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,960
Verdict in trial for quadruple murder.

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:26,240
Defendant: Wilhelm Antonius Wehren,
born in Essen on 30 May 1918.

4
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:30,800
Place of crime: Herzsprung,
near Wittstock (on the Dosse).

5
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,840
Date of crime: 30 April 1945.

6
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,280
Victims: Prisoners of Polish nationality,
identity unknown.

7
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,120
Willi Wehren is 21 when the war begins.

8
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,480
In the summer of 1939, he is drafted
into the Wehrmacht.

9
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,600
Wehren soon attracts negative attention:

10
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,000
accused of slander, 
he is tried by a military tribunal.

11
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,520
In 1943, he is ultimately accused 
of undermining military morale.

12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,600
Wehren is sent to
Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp.

13
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:15,960
It seems his fate is sealed.
But in April 1945, his fortunes turn.

14
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,480
The war’s end is looming.
The concentration camp is to be evacuated.

15
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,200
To do so, the SS also enlists inmates as guards.

16
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,880
Willi Wehren is recruited as well,
and is put in uniform again.

17
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:37,560
Issued with a rifle and ammunition,
he’s assigned to a column of five hundred women.

18
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,480
On 22 April, they set off
on the long journey to the north.

19
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,680
Theirs is the last group to march
from Sachsenhausen.

20
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,720
They wear little more than their threadbare
prisoners’ uniforms. Not all of them have shoes.

21
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,040
Many walk in wooden clogs
or improvise with rags wrapped around their feet.

22
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,320
They walk day after day.
Sometimes it’s 40 km, sometimes 20.

23
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,680
The thermometer barely gets above 0°C. 
They sometimes find a barn for the night.

24
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,400
But more often, they sleep out in the open.

25
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,760
Meanwhile, Wehren continues his rise. 
He receives a motorcycle.

26
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,760
As a despatch rider, he maintains contact
between marching groups.

27
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,080
He also has to look after the provisioning
of his group.

28
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,720
The march is torturous.

29
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,280
The prisoners are weakened
by their long internment.

30
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,920
Many are sick and starved.

31
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,720
Those who can’t keep up are shot by the SS 
and kicked into the ditch.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,360
More than a thousand dead are left
on the roads and fields.

33
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,880
Whoever can, keeps going.

34
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,480
Endless processions of misery
traverse the roads and villages.

35
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,920
There’s well over thirty thousand people.
Everyone can see them.

36
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,040
Hardly anyone feels sympathy for the prisoners,
and very few have the courage to help them.

37
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,280
Most react with mistrust, fear, or indifference.

38
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,920
So too in the little village of Herzsprung.

39
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,720
It’s here in this village
that Willi Wehren has abandoned his unit.

40
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,520
He meets a man named Berger.

41
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,160
This is another ex-prisoner who was hastily put
 in uniform when the death march began.

42
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,880
Wehren has taken up residence at the local inn.

43
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,800
He knows the innkeeper from before:
Wilhelm Leppin is an important man in Herzsprung.

44
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,120
He owns the inn
and is also the local Nazi Party chief.

45
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,160
In this village, he’s in charge...

46
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,120
...and the locals follow him willingly.

47
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,160
It’s Monday, the 30th of April.

48
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,240
In the morning, a 10-year-old boy comes
running up to Leppin with urgent news:

49
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,840
his mother has found four runaway prisoners
in the barn!

50
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,280
Leppin, Wehren, and Berger immediately rush
to the woman’s farm

51
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:33,560
and find four frightened Polish prisoners
 who had managed to escape the death march.

52
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,080
They force them out of hiding.

53
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,160
Wehren starts beating them. 
Leppin finds a cudgel.

54
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,880
He likewise beats them and yells:
‘Come out here, you swine!’

55
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,640
The three men talk it over.

56
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,200
They don’t want any hassle.
To them, the Poles are a burden.

57
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,720
Leppin decides it’d be best to get rid of them.

58
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,840
A family in Herzsprung is getting ready to flee
from the approaching Red Army.

59
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,160
They suddenly hear a clamour
outside their window.

60
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,920
The Polish prisoners are being herded
through Herzsprung,

61
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,680
across the village road and past the local homes
to the village outskirts.

62
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:28,640
The family watches the entourage with its trail of
curious onlookers, including several children.

63
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,360
Just before the gravel pit, on a small tree-covered slope,
the procession comes to a halt.

64
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,280
Among them is the local Nazi official Leppin.

65
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,960
He stays somewhat apart, smoking a cigar,
but follows the proceedings closely.

66
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,760
A scuffle begins.
One of the prisoners tries to escape.

67
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,960
Willi Wehren chases him and shoots.

68
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,080
The victim goes down, but is still alive.

69
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,480
Wehren flips him over with his foot 
and kills him with a second shot. 

70
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,880
Berger and Wehren now force the remaining prisoners
around the slope to the gravel pit.

71
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,480
What happens next is not visible to the onlookers.

72
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,800
But the tommy gun’s shots still echo
through the whole village.

73
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,080
The villagers watch transfixed.

74
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,360
Seven witnesses claim they saw or heard for themselves
the execution of the camp prisoners.

75
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,440
They testify that other villagers also followed
the events from close up.

76
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:13,200
On 10 Dec. 1955, the Potsdam District Court
sentences Wehren to death for quadruple murder.

77
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,080
A year later, his sentence is commuted
to life imprisonment.

78
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,280
In August 1975, Wehren is pardoned 
and released from prison.

79
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,800
He moves to West Germany.

80
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,200
Leppin is arrested by the Soviet military authorities
in May 1945.

81
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,600
As a Nazi Party official, 
he is sent to an internment camp.

82
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,680
He is released in August 1948.

83
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,200
He is never charged for the murders 
in Herzsprung.

84
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:54,320
The case against Leppin is dismissed due to
his ‘minor responsibility’. He remains unpunished.

85
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,720
A denunciation, a capture, a public execution.

86
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,720
In broad daylight, in the middle of the village,
in view of the people.

87
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,480
They stick together, and beyond 
the mass murder too:

88
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,160
the bodies are quickly buried, and with them,
the knowledge of that heinous event.

89
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,040
In Herzsprung, a silence gradually settles.

90
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:30,480
Soon, there is no one here who still remembers
the executed Polish prisoners.

91
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,480
Their names remain unknown.
