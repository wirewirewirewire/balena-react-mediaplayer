1
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,220
There wasn’t any resistance.

2
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,260
We didn’t have to force our way in.

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,640
We simply drove in.

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:19,500
There was just this big gate.

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,120
And we opened it.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:26,560
The first thing I saw were the barracks, but no people.

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,980
They were hiding.

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,660
They still didn’t know the war was over.

9
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,080
I didn't really understand that we were liberated.

10
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,280
Not until the war was over.

11
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,900
I didn’t have any sense of real happiness.

12
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:54,180
I felt alone, 
in every way.

13
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,200
Maybe it would’ve been different
if my parents had still been with me.

14
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:13,360
Thomas Bürgenthal is a child, 
just 10 years old.

15
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,240
He arrives at Sachsenhausen
 having already come a long way.

16
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,560
For four long years,
he and his family are stuck  in the Kielce Ghetto.

17
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:30,560
In 1944, he is deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau 
and separated from his parents.

18
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,320
In January 1945, 
Auschwitz is evacuated.

19
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:40,660
Joining the children’s section of the death march, 
Thomas walks for days through ice and snow.

20
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,980
A train finally brings them to Oranienburg.

21
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,800
His feet are half-frozen as he enters the camp,
 just outside town.

22
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,620
During these days, 
many transports arrive at Sachsenhausen.

23
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,220
The camp is hopelessly overcrowded.

24
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,720
Up to a hundred inmates die every day.

25
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,000
Thomas Bürgenthal is in a great deal of pain.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,160
The toes of his right foot are getting darker and darker.

27
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,800
He is sent to the infirmary.

28
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:15,120
He’s afraid of this facility, 
because at Auschwitz it was the most certain way to the gas chamber.

29
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,100
He’s told to remove his shoes.

30
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,500
A doctor examines his feet.

31
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,040
The boy is laid on a wooden table.

32
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,920
Two men come over and grab his arms and legs.

33
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,480
They hold him down.

34
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,500
Thomas starts screaming.

35
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:40,660
They put a white cloth over his face 
and he quickly loses consciousness.

36
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:46,140
When he wakes up, 
he’s in a sickroom.

37
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,820
Two toes from his right foot have been amputated.

38
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:10,000
Bernhard Storch swears to give his life 
for Poland in the battle against the German army.

39
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:16,260
He swears absolute loyalty to the Soviet Union
 in the fight against their common enemy.

40
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,260
Bernhard Storch is 16 when the Germans invade Poland.

41
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,060
He’s Jewish.

42
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:31,380
He escapes the looming persecution and goes to the Soviet Union.

43
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:37,780
There, in the spring of 1943, 
he joins a Polish unit of the Red Army.

44
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:41,840
He believes this to be his only way back home.

45
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,580
Their division includes more than twelve thousand men.

46
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,340
Storch joins the artillery.

47
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,280
He enters the war with the Belorussian Front.

48
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,120
As they advance, 
they follow a trail of devastation and horror.

49
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:06,980
 In a forest, they discover a railway track 
which leads them to a place called Sobibor.

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,920
But there’s nothing there.

51
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:14,020
Only bare soil with a few trees, 
and not a single soul.

52
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:19,040
There’s no one around 
who could tell them what happened here.

53
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,440
They have no time to stop somewhere, 
no time to think.

54
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,380
The war’s imperatives push them onwards.

55
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,680
They reach Majdanek.

56
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,340
This place of horror has also been abandoned.

57
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:42,560
They find thousands of suitcases and mountains of shoes, 
and Storch fears that the personal effects might include those of his family,

58
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,800
whose whereabouts are unknown to him.

59
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,240
They move on.

60
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,180
Storch looks down at himself.

61
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,800
He sees his shoes.

62
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,620
They’re all white.

63
00:04:53,660 --> 00:05:00,320
White from the crematorium ashes
that are scattered over the surrounding fields.

64
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:09,920
In April 1945, 
Storch’s division reaches the Oder river.

65
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:18,460
He sees how the river is filled with soldiers’ blood, and bodies, 
but must keep advancing without looking back.

66
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,900
At the same time,
things are getting worse around Oranienburg too.

67
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:28,900
 In March and April 1945, 
the town is heavily bombarded by air.

68
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,840
The front line is getting closer.

69
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:41,140
With the Battle of the Seelow Heights, 
the Red Army begins its final push: <i>The Berlin Offensive</i>.

70
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:48,380
Nearby at Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp, 
Thomas Bürgenthal hears the Allied bombers.

71
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,260
Lying in the infirmary barracks, 
he dreams himself away.

72
00:05:51,300 --> 00:06:04,560
He imagines one of the big planes coming down and lifting
the barracks with a big hook, taking it away to England or America.

73
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,140
One morning, 
the sun is shining through the infirmary’s small window.

74
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,040
Thomas Bürgenthal wakes up.

75
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,580
He limps out onto the muster ground.

76
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,360
It’s completely empty!

77
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,420
The SS has evacuated the camp.

78
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,960
He looks up at the balcony of the administration building.

79
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,120
There’s no longer anyone behind the big machine gun.

80
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,200
The other watchtowers too: abandoned.

81
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,440
Suddenly he hears a creaking sound.

82
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,940
The big gate is opening.

83
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,780
He sees some soldiers getting out of a military vehicle.

84
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,320
They don’t look like SS.

85
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,680
They’ve got uniforms he’s never seen before.

86
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,080
And then the camp’s bell starts ringing.

87
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:00,340
One of the soldiers is striking it with all his strength 
while another shouts across the muster ground:

88
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,280
<i>‘Hitler kaput! Hitler kaput!’</i>

89
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,660
When Bernhard Storch enters the camp, 
he doesn’t see the inmates right away.

90
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,920
They stay in their barracks and hide.

91
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:26,760
But then they’re there.

92
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,260
It’s the first time
that they’re liberating people.

93
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:37,960
There are thousands of them, including many women,
with wretched clothes and shorn hair.

94
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,260
They’re hardly recognizable as human beings.

95
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,920
They weep unceasingly.

96
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:51,880
The liberators distribute water among the prisoners
and assure them that their troubles are over.

97
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,980
They are free.

98
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:08,160
Thomas Bürgenthal roams the camp 
and discovers an unlocked office.

99
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,040
A portrait of Hitler hangs above the desk.

100
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,960
He climbs up and tears down the picture.

101
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,820
He dashes it on the floor.

102
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,080
The frame breaks and the glass shatters.

103
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:27,860
He spits on it and tramples Hitler’s face with such rage that his feet hurt,

104
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,820
but he keeps going until the picture is in tatters.

105
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:45,500
Thomas Bürgenthal leaves Oranienburg with the Polish Kościuszko Division. 
It’s in Berlin that he sees the end of the war.

106
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,000
They take him to a Jewish orphanage near Warsaw.

107
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,500
Bürgenthal’s father is murdered at the camp in Flossenbürg.

108
00:08:52,500 --> 00:09:00,000
His mother Gerda survives, and after several months, she finds her son in Poland.
They move to Göttingen. In 1951, Bürgenthal emigrates to the USA.

109
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,250
After the fall of Berlin,
Bernhard Storch returns to Poland in search of his family.

110
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:11,250
They’re all dead.Their home is destroyed. 
He never returns to his home town again.

111
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:15,250
In September 1945, he marries his wife Ruth in Katowice. 


112
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:20,300
In April 1947, with two suitcases and $20, they board a ship for New York.
